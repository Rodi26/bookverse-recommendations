# BookVerse Core Demo Configuration
# 
# DEMO PURPOSE: This file demonstrates the unified YAML configuration
# system that replaces the different configuration approaches across services.
#
# This configuration will be merged with:
# 1. Default values (lowest priority)
# 2. This YAML file 
# 3. Environment variables with DEMO_ prefix
# 4. Direct overrides (highest priority)

# Service metadata
service_name: "BookVerse Core Demo Service"
service_description: "Demonstration of bookverse-core library eliminating code duplication"

# Demo-specific settings
demo_message: "Welcome to the BookVerse Core Library Demo!"
max_demo_items: 100
enable_demo_features: true

# Environment settings
environment: "development"
debug: true
log_level: "INFO"

# Authentication settings (can be overridden by environment variables)
auth_enabled: true
development_mode: true
oidc_authority: "https://dev-auth.bookverse.com"
oidc_audience: "bookverse:api"

# API settings
api_version: "v1"

# Database settings (SQLite for demo simplicity)
database_url: "sqlite:///./bookverse_core_demo.db"

# Demo notes: These are comments and won't be loaded as configuration
# Purpose: Demonstrate unified configuration system
# Replaces:
#   - Inventory service hardcoded constants
#   - Recommendations service YAML + caching + env overrides
#   - Checkout service dataclass + env mapping
#   - Platform service mixed YAML + env approach
# Benefits:
#   - Single configuration pattern for all services
#   - Type-safe configuration with Pydantic validation
#   - Multiple source support with clear precedence
#   - Environment variable overrides for deployment flexibility
