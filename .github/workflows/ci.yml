# 🚀 BOOKVERSE RECOMMENDATIONS SERVICE - CI/CD WORKFLOW
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# PURPOSE: Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for the BookVerse Recommendations service
# demonstrating enterprise-grade software delivery with AppTrust integration.
#
# OVERVIEW:
# This workflow implements a complete software delivery lifecycle including:
# - ✅ Multi-artifact build (API image, Worker image, Config, Resources)
# - ✅ Comprehensive testing with coverage reporting
# - ✅ Security scanning and evidence collection
# - ✅ JFrog Artifactory integration with build-info publishing
# - ✅ AppTrust application version creation and promotion
# - ✅ Evidence attachment at package and application levels
# - ✅ Automated promotion through DEV → QA → STAGING → PROD
#
# ARCHITECTURE:
# 1. analyze-commit: Determines if app version should be created (smart filtering)
# 2. build-test-publish: Builds artifacts, runs tests, publishes to Artifactory
# 3. create-promote: Creates AppTrust app version and promotes through stages
#
# DEMO-READY: Automatic triggers enabled for full CI/CD pipeline demonstration
# PRODUCTION NOTE: Real systems would have additional branch protection and approval gates

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 🔒 CONCURRENCY CONTROL
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Prevents race conditions when multiple runs modify the same JFrog objects
# (builds, artifacts, application versions) simultaneously

      # ─── Semantic Version Determination ───
      # OVERVIEW: This is a CRITICAL step that determines smart, consistent version numbers
      # for all packages and the application using centralized bookverse-devops scripts.
      # The script analyzes existing versions and applies semantic versioning rules based
      # on commit content and version-map.yaml configuration.
      #
      # 🎯 WHY THIS MATTERS FOR DEMO:
      # - Demonstrates enterprise-grade versioning strategy with multiple artifact types
      # - Shows coordination between application versions and individual package versions
      # - Exhibits proper version increment logic (patch/minor/major) based on changes
      # - Provides traceability from commits to deployed artifacts
      #
      # 📋 VERSION STRATEGY EXPLAINED:
      # - Application Version: Single unified version for AppTrust application (e.g., 1.2.3)
      # - Package Versions: Individual versions per package type allowing independent updates:
      #   * recommendations (Docker): 1.2.3 (API service)
      #   * recommendations-worker (Docker): 1.2.4 (Worker service)  
      #   * recommendation-config (Generic): 1.2.1 (Configuration bundle)
      #   * resources (Generic): 1.2.2 (ML resources bundle)
      # - Build Number: GitHub Actions run-based for build-info tracking (e.g., 127-1)
      #
      # 🔄 SEMVER LOGIC WORKFLOW:
      # 1. Authenticate with JFrog using OIDC token from previous step
      # 2. Query JFrog repositories for existing versions of each package type
      # 3. Parse config/version-map.yaml for package-specific versioning rules
      # 4. Analyze commit content to determine appropriate increment type
      # 5. Calculate new versions using semantic versioning rules
      # 6. Return JSON output with both application_version and individual package_tags
      #
      # 📂 INPUT SOURCES:
      # - ./config/version-map.yaml: Package versioning configuration and increment rules
      # - JFrog Repositories: Current package versions for smart increment calculation
      # - Git Commit History: Change analysis for determining semver increment type
      # - OIDC Token: Secure authentication for JFrog API access
      #
      # 📤 OUTPUT BEHAVIOR:
      # - Sets environment variables for each package version (RECOMMENDATIONS_VERSION, etc.)
      # - Creates application version for AppTrust integration (APP_VERSION)
      # - Enables independent package versioning while maintaining application coherence
      # - Provides build number for JFrog build-info association
      #
      # 🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:
      # - JF_OIDC_TOKEN must be present from previous OIDC exchange step
      # - config/version-map.yaml must exist and be properly formatted
      # - JFrog connectivity must be established for version queries
      # - Shared semver scripts must be available from bookverse-infra checkout

      # └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
      # OVERVIEW: Builds and publishes the main recommendation API service as a Docker image.
      # This is the primary service that handles HTTP requests for book recommendations.
      #
      # 🎯 WHY THIS MATTERS FOR DEMO:
      # - Demonstrates Docker image building integrated with JFrog CLI for build-info
      # - Shows proper image naming and tagging strategy for enterprise deployment
      # - Exhibits secure OIDC-based image pushing without long-lived credentials
      # - Provides foundation for evidence attachment and compliance tracking
      #
      # 🏗️ BUILD PROCESS:
      # 1. Use JFrog CLI server configuration from setup step (OIDC-authenticated)
      # 2. Construct image name using enterprise naming convention
      # 3. Build Docker image with proper labeling and metadata
      # 4. Push to JFrog Docker registry with automatic build-info association
      # 5. Prepare for evidence attachment in subsequent steps
      #
      # 📦 IMAGE DETAILS:
      # - Base Image: python:3.11-slim (optimized for FastAPI applications)
      # - Purpose: Main recommendation service API endpoints
      # - Registry: bookverse-recommendations-internal-docker-nonprod-local
      # - Tagging: Uses individual package version (RECOMMENDATIONS_VERSION)

      # OVERVIEW: Finalizes and publishes the comprehensive build-info that contains
      # all artifacts (Docker images and generic packages) with complete metadata.
      # This step creates the immutable build record for AppTrust integration.
      #
      # 🎯 WHY THIS MATTERS FOR DEMO:
      # - Creates immutable build record linking all artifacts to source code
      # - Enables AppTrust application version binding with complete artifact set
      # - Provides comprehensive audit trail for compliance and traceability
      # - Demonstrates enterprise build metadata management practices
      # - Supports downstream promotion and deployment processes
      #
      # 📋 BUILD-INFO CONTENTS:
      # - 2 Docker Images: API service and Worker service (already associated)
      # - 2 Generic Artifacts: Configuration bundle and Resources bundle
      # - Environment Information: Build environment, dependencies, timestamps
      # - Source Information: Git commit, branch, repository details
      # - Build Metadata: Build name, number, project, and execution context
      #
      # 🔄 PUBLICATION PROCESS:
      # 1. Collect Environment Information (jf rt bag)
      # 2. Collect Build Environment Details (jf rt bce)  
      # 3. Publish Complete Build-Info (jf rt bp)
      # 4. Extract Build Timestamp for downstream processes
      # 5. Validate publication success and availability
      #
      # 🚨 PREREQUISITES:
      # - All Docker images must be built, pushed, and associated
      # - All generic artifacts must be uploaded with build-info association
      # - Build name and number must be consistent across all operations

      # └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
      # OVERVIEW: Creates an AppTrust application version that binds all published artifacts
      # into a single, deployable application entity. This is the cornerstone of the
      # enterprise software delivery lifecycle, enabling coordinated multi-artifact deployments.
      #
      # 🎯 WHY THIS MATTERS FOR DEMO:
      # - Demonstrates enterprise application lifecycle management with AppTrust
      # - Shows coordination of multiple artifacts (2 Docker + 2 Generic) into single version
      # - Exhibits proper application versioning strategy separate from package versions
      # - Provides foundation for promotion through deployment stages (DEV→QA→STAGING→PROD)
      # - Showcases build-info binding for complete artifact traceability
      #
      # 🏗️ APPLICATION VERSION CONCEPT:
      # An AppTrust application version represents a specific, tested, deployable state
      # of the entire recommendations service including:
      # - API Docker image (recommendations:1.2.3)
      # - Worker Docker image (recommendations-worker:1.2.4) 
      # - Configuration bundle (recommendation-config:1.2.1)
      # - Resources bundle (resources:1.2.2)
      # - Build-info with full dependency metadata
      # - Attached evidence for security/quality compliance
      #
      # 🔗 BUILD-INFO BINDING PROCESS:
      # 1. Application version references specific build-info by name/number
      # 2. Build-info contains all artifacts published in build-test-publish job
      # 3. AppTrust automatically discovers and includes all artifacts from build-info
      # 4. Creates immutable link between application version and exact artifact set
      # 5. Enables atomic promotion of entire application as coordinated unit
      #
      # 📋 API CALL DETAILS:
      # - Endpoint: POST /apptrust/api/v1/applications/bookverse-recommendations/versions
      # - Authentication: Bearer token using JF_OIDC_TOKEN from OIDC exchange
      # - Payload includes application version, tag, and build-info source reference
      # - Response provides application version status and promotion readiness
      #
      # 🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:
      # - Build-info must be published and available in JFrog before API call
      # - Application version must be unique (no conflicts with existing versions)
      # - OIDC token must have sufficient permissions for AppTrust operations

      # - Exhibits proper promotion sequence (UNASSIGNED → DEV → QA → STAGING → PROD)
      # - Provides foundation for environment-specific configuration and testing
      # - Showcases integration between AppTrust promotion and evidence systems
      #
      # 🚀 DEV STAGE CHARACTERISTICS:
      # - Purpose: Development environment for feature testing and integration
      # - Promotion: Automatic upon successful application version creation
      # - Evidence: Smoke test results validating basic service functionality
      # - Configuration: Development-optimized settings (debug logging, relaxed timeouts)
      # - Deployment: Typically single-instance deployment with development data
      #
      # 📋 PROMOTION PROCESS:
      # 1. Source shared evidence library for promotion functions
      # 2. Set up promotion environment with AppTrust authentication
      # 3. Execute promotion using advance_one_step() function
      # 4. Generate DEV-specific evidence (smoke tests, health checks)
      # 5. Attach evidence to application version for compliance tracking
      # 6. Validate promotion success and update application status
      #
      # 🛡️ DEV STAGE EVIDENCE:
      # - Smoke Tests: Basic health check and endpoint responsiveness validation
      # - Service Discovery: Verification that service is discoverable in DEV environment
      # - Configuration Loading: Validation that DEV-specific configuration is applied
      # - Database Connectivity: Confirmation of database connections and schema
      #
      # 🔄 SHARED LIBRARY INTEGRATION:
      # - Uses advance_one_step() for consistent promotion logic across all services
      # - Employs attach_application_dev_evidence() for standardized evidence format
      # - Ensures consistent promotion behavior across BookVerse platform
      # - Provides centralized error handling and retry logic
      #
      # 🚨 SUCCESS CRITERIA:
      # - Application version must be in UNASSIGNED state before promotion
      # - AppTrust API must be accessible and responsive
      # - Evidence attachment must succeed for compliance requirements
      # - Service health checks must pass in DEV environment
