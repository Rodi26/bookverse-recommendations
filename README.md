- **GitOps Integration**: Automated deployment with ArgoCD
- **Multi-Environment**: Consistent deployment across development, staging, and production

### 📊 **Enterprise Operations**

- **Monitoring & Observability**: Built-in health checks and metrics collection
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling support for all services
- **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, retries, and graceful degradation
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific configuration with secrets management
