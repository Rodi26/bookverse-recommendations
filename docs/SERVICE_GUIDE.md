## 🎯 Service Overview

### Purpose
The BookVerse Recommendations Service is an AI-powered recommendation engine that provides personalized book suggestions to users based on their reading history, preferences, and behavioral patterns. The service is designed to showcase enterprise-grade software delivery practices while maintaining simplicity for demonstration purposes.

- **Scalable Architecture** - Independent scaling of API and worker components
- **Configurable Algorithms** - External configuration for easy tuning without code changes
- **Comprehensive Monitoring** - Full observability with health checks and metrics
- **Security First** - OIDC authentication and evidence-based compliance

### Artifacts Produced
1. **📱 API Service** - Main recommendation service (Docker image)
2. **🔧 Worker Service** - Background processing engine (Docker image)  
3. **⚙️ Configuration Bundle** - Algorithm parameters and settings (Generic artifact)
4. **📚 Resources Bundle** - ML models, stopwords, and training data (Generic artifact)

### Data Flow
1. **Indexing**: Worker service fetches book and transaction data from Inventory service
2. **Processing**: Algorithm engine builds inverted indices for genres and authors
3. **Caching**: Frequently accessed recommendations are cached with configurable TTL
4. **Serving**: API service responds to recommendation requests using cached and computed results

## 🧮 Algorithm

### Recommendation Algorithm

The service uses a sophisticated rule-based scoring system that balances multiple factors:

#### Scoring Formula
```
Score = (1.0 × genre_overlap) + (0.25 × author_overlap) + (0.10 × popularity_factor)
```

#### Components

1. **Genre Overlap** (Weight: 1.0)
   - Jaccard similarity between book genres
   - Primary factor for content-based recommendations

2. **Author Overlap** (Weight: 0.25)
   - Boolean match for same author
   - Promotes books by authors users already enjoy

3. **Popularity Factor** (Weight: 0.10)
   - Derived from recent stock_out transactions
   - Normalized to 0-1 range
   - Provides trending boost to recommendations

#### Process Flow

1. **Candidate Generation**
   - Extract genres and authors from seed book/user preferences
   - Query inverted indices for books sharing these attributes
   - Fallback to trending books if no matches found

2. **Scoring**
   - Calculate overlap scores for each candidate
   - Apply weighting formula
   - Filter out low-scoring results (configurable threshold)

3. **Ranking & Filtering**
   - Sort by final score (descending)
   - Apply availability filters if configured
   - Limit results to requested count

#### Configuration Parameters

```yaml
# config/recommendations-settings.yaml
algorithm:
  weights:
    genre_similarity: 0.4      # Genre overlap importance
    author_similarity: 0.3     # Author match importance
    popularity_boost: 0.2      # Trending factor importance
    recency_factor: 0.1        # Recent release boost
  thresholds:
    min_similarity: 0.1        # Minimum score to include
    max_recommendations: 50    # Maximum results to process
  filters:
    exclude_out_of_stock: true # Filter unavailable books
    exclude_adult_content: false # Content filtering
```
